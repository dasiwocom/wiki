# Markdown Wikilinks Connect Your Knowledge

## Why links matter

A knowledge base without links is a pile of isolated notes. Add `[[wikilink]]` between related notes and the vault becomes a **graph**: connections you can see, traverse, and ask questions about.

## Link forms

| Form                | Matches                                    |                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `[[Note-Name]]`     | Any note whose file name is `Note-Name.md` |                                |
| `[[dir/Note-Name]]` | A note at a specific path                  |                                |
| `[[Note-Name        | display text]]`                            | Same, with custom display text |

File names are matched by basename, so links survive small moves.

## What it unlocks

- **Graph view** draws one node per note and one line per link — the vault becomes visible structure.
- Backlinks ("who links to me") let readers discover related material they would never search for.
- The AI assistant treats linked context as stronger signal when answering.
